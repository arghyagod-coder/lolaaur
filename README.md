### `lolaAUR` : A simple CLI package manager for Arch/Arch Based Linux 

[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/lolaaur?period=total&units=abbreviation&left_color=black&right_color=blue&left_text=Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/lolaaur)

**lola is made for linux users who want to download software fast and easy!**

Now many will ask, Why use lola when we have those software managers?

Well, lola is a Command Line Interface and is used inside the terminal. And as we know, terminal downloads are way more faster than the software managers. While many softwares can be downloaded with a single `pacman -S`, most common ones need some more commands.

So `lola` is here to make your life way more easier while installing software! This project targets both advanced and beginner users, because who doesn't like speedy and quicky stuff?

#### Dependencies

### Built with

## Installation

#### Method 1 (Recommended):

If you dont have python3 and pip installed on your system, or are not that much of PYTHON CODER, use this method

- Install wget with `sudo pacman -S wget`

- In your terminal-

```bash
cd ~/Downloads;wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arghyagod-coder/lolaaur/master/lolaaur/install.sh; sudo bash install.sh
```

- Now `lola` is ready to work!

#### Method 2

If you have python and pip installed in your computer, execute the following

```bash

But, there are some dependencies that you will need if you go for method 2. They are the following:

- git (`sudo pacman -S git`)
- yay (`sudo pacman -S yay`)
